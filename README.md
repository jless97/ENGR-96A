## Background
This course served as an introduction to embedded systems with the use of an 
Intel Edison and the Grove Sensor Kit. In addition to embedded systems, this
course involved applying security measures to an Internet of Things (IoT) 
device. The main goal of this course was to create an IoT security system
using the Intel Edison and the Grove Kit light sensor in order to send a
Username/Password combination over to a server in order to simulate the 
unlocking of a door.
