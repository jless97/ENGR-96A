# ENGR96A - Introduction to Engineering Design & Embedded Systems, Spring 2017 

## Course Objectives
* Introduction to practical engineering aspects of their discipline through hands-on development of an embeeded system for use in the Internet of Things.
* The main project involved creating an IoT security system using the Intel Edison and the Grover Kit sensors to send an encrypted message to a server to simulate unlocking a door

## Course Description
Introduction to engineering design while building teamwork and communication skills and examination of engineering majors offered at UCLA and of engineering careers. Completion of hands-on engineering design projects, preparation of short report describing projects, and presentation of results.

### Tools Used
* Hardware: Intel Edison & Grover Sensor Kit
* Programming Language: Embedded C

### Assignment Overviews
* H1 - Light Intensity Threshold
  * Simple use of the light sensor in tandem with the Intel Edison to determine binary light intensity threshold
* P1A - Networked Lock, Simple Implementation
  * Password-authenticated IoT system for door opening using Intel Edison and a single light sensor
* P1B - Networked Lock, Secure Implementation
  * Password-authenticated IoT system for door opening using Intel Edison and multiple light sensors, a push button, and encrypted network communication
